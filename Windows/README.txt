Assignment 2

Note:
The Windows implementation was attempted, but incomplete and currently does not compile.
There are changes to the binder.py and binderbackend.cpp files to get it working. The
binder.py file currently generates the codearray.h file correctly under windows (without
the unix hexdump utility) and Windows MinGW was used to attempt compiling the program
under Windows 7. In binderbackend.cpp, the logic is there to successfully complete the
assignment, however it currently does not work.
